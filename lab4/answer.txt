1. Compile and run the code in the file partB/race_condition.c, compile and run the code.
What is your output? What is the expected output? How does this output generated?

my output:
Expected count: 0 (because half increment and half decrement)
Actual count: -22508

expect output:
Expected count: 0 (because half increment and half decrement)
Actual count: 0

This output generated because race condition happens between threads, which write to a single variable simultaneously,
and result undefined outcomes
